# Linux Cleaner
The goal of Linux Cleaner is to **make system cache cleaning easier**, since it is common to forget to clean our cache, which ends up taking up a large amount of disk space.
The program also includes the option to clean the cache of the system’s package managers, further helping to free up storage.

## Interfaces
The program provides both a **GUI** and a **CLI**, allowing the user to choose whichever is more comfortable for them.

## Stack
The program was developed entirely in **Python**. It uses the **subprocess** library to run system-level processes and the **customtkinter** and **Pillow** libraries for the GUI.

* *The program is open source, so feel free to contribute to the code :)*
